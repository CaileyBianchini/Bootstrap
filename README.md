# Bootstrat OpenGL

## Summary
This shows my proficiency in creating lights from a engine that was created from scratch that did not set up a light.
This also shows my ability to add textures to objects such as planes.  

The lights seperately:
![Light One adds depth](Extra/light 1.PNG)
![Light two adds light in other areas](Extra/light 2.PNG)

Light together:
![The dragon no longer looks slimy](Extra/light combined.PNG)
